                <p class="description">The <a href="https://www.bgmea.com.bd/page/AboutGarmentsIndustry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">readymade garments (RMG)</a> industry is the backbone of Bangladesh’s economic success story. This sector of Bangladesh has got a greater facet than any other sector in its economic success story. RMG exports in Bangladesh amounted to approximately 84 percent of the total exports. It is expected that by 2030 the tech industry will be changed completely. Thus, to prosper in the next decade it is necessary to adapt the changes immediately to maintain a competitive edge.<br><br>
                
                Keeping that in mind, a handful of Bangladeshi corporate houses have taken the initiative to get to the next stage. BlueBees Ltd. has introduced an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technological platform called ‘Knittersland’, a global hub for apparel sourcing. In this regard, BlueBees Ltd. and <a href="https://www.bgmea.com.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BGMEA</a> leaders met at the BGMEA headquarters on the 17th of January 2022. In favour of BlueBees Ltd, <a href="https://www.index-companies.com/board-of-directors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managing Director, Mr. Mahin Mazher</a> and Director, Mr. Rezaul Karim, along with BGMEA President, Mr. Faruque Hassan were present.<br><br>
                
                <a href="https://www.knittersland.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knittersland</a> aims to stand beside those factories which are falling behind and
                cannot reach all buyers to source orders as per their factory requirement and capacity, because of financial constraints or educational shortcomings. The goal is to establish a healthy ecosystem of a trustworthy business relationship between apparel sourcing and manufacturing industries. By implementing an integrated digital platform, ‘Knittersland’ provides one stop service, eliminating unnecessary middleman involvement, hoping to give benevolent support to the underutilised factories and create more employment opportunities.</p>
